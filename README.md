# Nickname Backstory

Relatively long ago while playing Lineage 2 c4 I've come up with a nickname **EJIEKTPOBEHUK** (imitation of Russian **ЕЛЕКТРОВЕНИК** [ˈəlektro.ˈvʲenʲɪk], where **ЕЛЕКТРО** means electric, **ВЕНИК** - type of broom).
Somewhat normal transcription is electrovenik.

Venik is made of many thin branches.
This makes it look vulnerable coz it's easy to break a thin branch.
It's a rather common example of misjudgment.
Even though a branch alone is weak, venik consists of several dozens of them.
Which makes venik very tough.

Idea was that I'm rather agile, energetic and seen some stuff in the dark corners of the surroundings.
Venik's toughness represents persistence in achieving far from low hanging goals.
